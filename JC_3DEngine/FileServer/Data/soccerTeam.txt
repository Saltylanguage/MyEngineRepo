We want to create a database consisting of a few tables to represent a soccer team. Here are the data:
1) A team consist of 16 or more members.
2) It's a coed team, so they can be either male or female.
3) Each player has personal properties age, height, weight, data of birth.
4) Each member can have one of the following roles: Player, Couch, Assistent, Manager, Staff. Each member has a yearly salary and length of being with the team ( in months)
5) Each player has a set of general physical sportive properties: max speed, max jump, reaction time(in milliseconds), Time2MaxSpeed(in sec), stamina(in min time to run 5k)
6) Each player has a few properties related to soccer: first favorite position, second favorite position, # goals scored, # of assists (goal passes), Longest pass, Max time holding a ball(seconds), max length running with ball(meter, max distance run in a game(in km)

Soccer positions are: Goalie, center Def, Left Def, Right Def, MidField Center, Left Mid, Right Mid, Forward Center, Forward Left, Forward Right.

Implement the above data in a few tables on paper chooing the primary keys and corresponding attributes. Try to design in a way such that each table represent one aspect or related aspects of the team. Also try not to have too many common attributes among the tables.

Implement your design on the website we used in class. Then do the following queries:

1) select all players who are older than 21 and like play forward in general.
2) select all players who are taller than 1.75 m and scored or assisted more than 5 goals.
3) Compute average of all female players age.
4) Compute average salary of all team members.
5) show all players who are taller than 1.8m and younger than 29.
